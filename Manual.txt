Installation

macOS
	1.	Install Homebrew:
If you don’t have Homebrew installed, you can install it using the following command:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"


	2.	Install Dependencies:
You need to install the following dependencies:

brew install imagemagick boost opencv
brew install gh


	3.	Clone the Repository:
Clone the AI Compiler Plus repository from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/joeysoprano420/AI-Compiler-Plus.git
cd AI-Compiler-Plus


	4.	Ensure ImageMagick is Working:
Confirm that ImageMagick is properly installed:

convert --version


	5.	Python Dependencies:
For Python integration, you can install the required Python packages:

python3 -m pip install -r dependencies.txt



⸻

Linux
	1.	Install Dependencies:
Update your package manager and install required dependencies:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install imagemagick libboost-all-dev libopencv-dev gh python3-pip


	2.	Clone the Repository:
Clone the AI Compiler Plus repository:

git clone https://github.com/joeysoprano420/AI-Compiler-Plus.git
cd AI-Compiler-Plus


	3.	Ensure ImageMagick is Working:
Check if ImageMagick is installed correctly:

convert --version


	4.	Install Python Dependencies:
Install required Python dependencies:

python3 -m pip install -r dependencies.txt


rd
⸻

Windows
	1.	Install ImageMagick:
	•	Download the latest version of ImageMagick from ImageMagick Downloads.
	•	Follow the installer prompts and ensure that “Install legacy utilities (e.g., convert)” is checked.
	2.	Install GitHub CLI:
	•	Download and install the GitHub CLI from GitHub CLI Downloads.
	3.	Install Python:
	•	Ensure Python is installed from Python.org.
	4.	Clone the Repository:
Clone the AI Compiler Plus repository from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/joeysoprano420/AI-Compiler-Plus.git
cd AI-Compiler-Plus


	5.	Install Python Dependencies:
For Python integration, install the required dependencies:

python -m pip install -r dependencies.txt


	6.	Test ImageMagick:
After installation, open a Command Prompt (cmd) and type:

convert --version



⸻

Setup and Configuration
	1.	Configure Paths:
Make sure all tools (ImageMagick, Python, GitHub CLI) are in your system PATH to access them globally from the terminal.
	2.	Set up the Environment:
Before running the tool, ensure your environment is correctly set up:
	•	Confirm that you have access to the necessary tools (ImageMagick, Python, etc.) in your terminal.
	•	For GitHub operations, ensure you are logged in using GitHub CLI (gh auth login).

⸻

Usage

Compiling Code
	1.	Compiling C++ Code:
Use the provided C++ codebase to compile and package C++ code.
	•	Ensure you have the necessary build tools (G++, Clang, etc.) installed.
	•	Compile the code using:

g++ -o output_program source_code.cpp


	•	Or use the batch script provided for automated compilation.

	2.	Running the Python Code:
If using Python for additional functionality, you can execute the Python code as follows:

python3 script.py



⸻

Converting PNG to ICO
	1.	Using ImageMagick:
To convert a PNG image to ICO format, use the provided Bash or Windows scripts:

./convert_png_to_ico.sh input_image.png output_icon.ico


	2.	For Windows:
If you’re using Windows, the process is similar but executed in the Command Prompt:

convert input_image.png output_icon.ico



⸻

GitHub Integration
	1.	Automating GitHub Deployment:
The script automates the deployment process to GitHub:
	•	Add your GitHub credentials using gh auth login.
	•	Commit and push your changes using the following command:

git add .
git commit -m "Automated Commit"
git push origin main



⸻

Dependencies

To ensure everything runs smoothly, make sure the following dependencies are installed:

Tools and Libraries:
	1.	ImageMagick (For image conversion)
	2.	GitHub CLI (For automated GitHub operations)
	3.	Boost C++ Libraries (Optional, for additional utilities)
	4.	OpenCV (Optional, if using for image or video processing)
	5.	Python and relevant libraries:
	•	numpy
	•	pillow
	•	requests

⸻

Troubleshooting
	1.	ImageMagick not found:
Ensure that ImageMagick is properly installed and the executable (convert) is in your system’s PATH.
	2.	Python dependencies not installed:
If you encounter errors related to missing Python dependencies, make sure to run:

python3 -m pip install -r dependencies.txt


	3.	GitHub CLI authentication issues:
If the GitHub CLI (gh) isn’t working properly, reauthenticate using:

gh auth login


	4.	Compilation errors:
If you’re facing compilation errors, make sure your C++ code is correctly written and that the necessary libraries (like Boost or OpenCV) are installed.
