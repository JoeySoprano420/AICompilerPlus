# This list covers key dependencies for core functionalities, real-time communication between the components, task management, AI-based prioritization, and system logging.

# Python Version: Ensure the Python interpreter version matches the one specified in the dependencies.

# C++ Libraries: Precompiled binaries for libraries like Boost and gRPC may need to be installed separately or included in the bundle.

# Cross-Platform Compatibility: All dependencies should work on the target operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).

# Bundling Tools: The final executable will use PyInstaller for Python and CMake for C++ compilation.
